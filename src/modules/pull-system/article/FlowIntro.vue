      In lean manufacturing, one key aspect is the notion of
      <em>lead time</em>: the time needed by the company to deliver the product
      requested by the client starting when the client makes the order. For lean
      practitioners, the way to deliver at the right time is by improving how
      their delivery system works with... The pull system!

      The pull system is in opposition of the push system. Instead of trying to
      make everyone work at their maximum capacity, we try to improve the time
      it needs to deliver a feature.
