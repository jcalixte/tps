      The fact that

      is counter-intuitive but it is a fact. The more we push the more we are
      slowing down the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      When money and pressure are in the game, fear, uncertainty, and doubt
      spread out rapidly. So we rush, as fast as we can, and when a team has
      nothing to do, it becomes a disaster: money are being burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teams will overproduce. They will do every pieces they can as they can:
      product team will prepare their features, designers will design every
      screens, developers will rush to code. Then, they struggle to get these
      pieces to the very end. So the fear of having nothing to give to the next
      team pushes us to produce just in case. Bugs lead to more bugs that lead
      to more bugs. The productivity drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the <PullSystemIcon /> pull system is here to change our priority.
      Developpers are the clients of the Designer team, as well as Designers are
      the client of the Product team. Focusing on the lead time is asking to the
      next team: "Is this what you need? How can we help each other?". This is
      the question of team work.
