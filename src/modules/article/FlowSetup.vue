      You're a Product Manager in a project who has just started, your goal is
      to make a product as fast as you can. With you, you'll have the product
      team, designers, developers and a release team.
    </p>
    <p>This is a feature:</p>
    <FeatureItem :feature="feature" />
    <p>
      <span class="numeric">({{ feature.complexity }})</span> is the complexity
      of the feature. The more complex a feature is, the more chance to have
      defect we have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="numeric">{{ feature.leadTime }}d</span> is the number of days
      the feature started its journey. The ultimate goal is to reduce this
      number and deliver as fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <QualityIssue class="inline" :quality-issue="feature.qualityIssue" />
      are the number of defects the feature had during the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have 20 features to deliver, and each day you can choose between 3
      strategies:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Push system
        <PushSystemIcon />
      </li>
      <li>
        Pull system
        <PullSystemIcon />
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem solving
        <ProblemSolvingIcon />
      </li>
    </ol>
    <FlowControls :with-eraser="false" />
    <p>
      In this article we'll focus on how these strategies are efficient and what
      are the impact on the quality the teams produce.
    </p>
    <h3>The push system: start features as many as possible</h3>
    <p>
      Pushing all the feature as fast as possible, we make the assumption that
      we can deliver in (# step Ã— # features = 150 days) if everything goes
      well. The fastest a team can do. We overburden the teams but it's for the
      good cause. We already payed everybody to work so if there is someone who
      has nothing to do, this is just money down the drain.
    </p>
    <h3>The pull system: make features only when the next team needs it</h3>
    <p>
      We know that we will never reach the best score ever: the push system
      where everything goes right. But we limit overburden. We know we prefer
      waiting for next team to be ready before doing some extra work than having
      stock of feature pre-baked.
    </p>
    <h3>Problem solving: no production, just reflection</h3>
    <p>
      We invest days where we are not productive at all to investigate and
      learning from our mistake. We know that we will never reach the best score
      ever and we know that mistakes will reappear. So we take more time to
      understand and limit rework. The more the team investigate, the more the
      team learn and start to be extremely good at problem solving.
    </p>
    <h3>Blue bin: the security stock</h3>
    <p>
      Blue bins are your security stock, to make sure teams can work without any
      blockers. It's to make sure the next team will always have material to
      transform. But it comes with a cost: overburden, stagnation (increase lead
      time) and duplicated mistakes (not simulated here). The less you have, the
      less your team has mental charge. The more you have, the more secure you
      are to make teams work. One solution: simplify your flow and lower the
      number of operation the teams have to do to deliver a feature.
