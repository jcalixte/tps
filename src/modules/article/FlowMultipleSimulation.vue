      Teams tend to underestimate how long a project will be. And how hard it
      will be to work with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we're not in a good pace, we just have to try harder. Only once. "Just
      in time" becomes "Just this time". So teams overproduce. Creating stock
      and latent defects the teams need to rework. The worse the project do, the
      more silot we become and we tend to argue with a "I've done my job, if the
      project fails it's not my fault.". The fact is that it's nobody's fault,
      it's a system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short term objectives become the norm. It is never the right time to do
      problem solving. To think on how we think.
