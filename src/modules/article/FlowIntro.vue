      This article is here to plan ahead ourselves to what can be misconceptions
      on how to be effective. Teams will overproduce. They will do everything
      piece they can as they are autonomous. They will then struggle to get
      these pieces to the very end when they will transfer them to the others
      teams. Multitasking will drastically drop the productivity. So the fear of
      having nothing to give to the next team pushes us to produce just in case.
      Bugs lead to more bugs that lead to more bugs.

      When money and pressure are in the game, fear, uncertainty, and doubt
      spread out rapidly.
