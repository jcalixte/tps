    <h2>What's the fatest way to deliver an app?</h2>
    <p>
      How good are we to succeed a project? Delivering the features at the good
      quality and at the right time. We're pretty bad at it and there is a lot
      of misconceptions on how to manage people to do what need to be done. I
      wanted to create a simulation to plan ahead and see what are the
      consequences of different strategy patterns and which is the most
      effective.
