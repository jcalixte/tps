      When money and pressure are in the game, fear, uncertainty, and doubt
      spread out rapidly. So we rush, as fast as we can, and when a team has
      nothing to do, it becomes a disaster: money are being burned.

      Teams will overproduce. They will do every pieces they can as they are
      autonomous: product team will pitch their features, designers will design
      every pages, developers will rush to code forgetting why the customer
      needs this precise feature. They will then struggle to get these pieces to
      the very end when they will transfer them to the others teams. So the fear
      of having nothing to give to the next team pushes us to produce just in
      case. Bugs lead to more bugs that lead to more bugs. Multitasking will
      drastically drop the productivity.

      But the best way to succeed is to ask: "Is this what you need? How can I
      help you?". Just like in Ekiden, handovers are where the real struggles
      happen but we're on the same race, together.
