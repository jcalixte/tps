## Feature flow

### The project

- 0 defect policy,
- has no external dependancies,
- the team has a strong opinion on Jidoka:
  - teams spot 100% of the defects,
  - teams do not take a feature who has defects,
  - the team who introduced the defect needs to rework on the feature.
- there is no limit on how many defects a feature can have.
